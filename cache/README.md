Please use this directory for storing files the bot generates or downloads.
If you want to organize and reduce bloat, consider first downloading a file to this directory, and use a FileCacheList to manage a subdirectory.
See an example in TTS: `discord_slash_commands/tts.py` and `discord_slash_commands/helpers/file_cache.py`.
